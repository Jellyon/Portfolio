# Portfolio

These are a bunch of simple projects, some may be incomplete. I have plenty more projects to add; as I get the time I will continue to add to this list.

Most of these projects were homeworks from my university, but nonetheless show some basic programming principles.

It is my hope that you are an employer and these projects help spark a conversation for an interview!

Have a wonderful day!
