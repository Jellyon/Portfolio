These are relevant scripts from my Senior Design (capstone) project, for my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, from Cleveland State University. I created several, not all, of these scripts implemented by my team for the Hollow Cathode Visualization project for NASA for their internal educational resources. 
The visualizations was coded in C# (.NET framework) using the Unity Engine to create a three dimensional environment showcasing NASA's Hollow Cathode technology. 
My work on the project involved creating the camera and movement controls, as well as the camera movement/positioning during cutscenes.
These scripts are here so that I may explain certain design decisions and data flow within the project, not to display the visualization.
